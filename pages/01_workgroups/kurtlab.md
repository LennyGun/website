##Kurt Lab - Pathophysiology of the Auditory System

Our research is focused on neuroprosthetic devices within the auditory system and methods of artificial stimulation of the nervous system to replace lost auditory function. We try to replace lost neural function by an implant to understand how artificial stimulation will represent the world and how neuronal circuits process information. 

The goal of our research is to understand the neuronal mechanisms by which neurons in the auditory cortex construct a precise representation of acoustic signals resulting from neuronal implants. Using chronic recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex,  we try to identify such sound representations. 
Another line of research in the laboratory investigates auditory discrimination learning and auditory perception.
