##Kurt Lab - Pathophysiology of the Auditory System

The cochlear implant is a powerful solution for most sensorineural hearing loss patients. However, there is a minority of patients with impaired auditory nerve who would not benefit from a chochlear implant. A solution for those patients are auditory midbrain implants. For such devices, knowledge about the processing between these lower-order structures and the cortical representation needs still to be gathered. 

Our research is centered around stimulation of the auditory midbrain in order to elicit a hearing sensation.
We aim to develop new stimulation paradigms and prosthesis concepts by investigating cortical and subcortical processing.
Our employed methods include standard electrophysiological techniques, behavioural experimental systems as well as cutting-edge optogenetics.
